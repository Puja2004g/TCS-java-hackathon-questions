Title: Grain Inventory Management

Create a class Grain with the below private attributes:

grainid – int

grainName – String

state – String

qtyinQuintal – int

Write getters, setters, and parameterized constructors in the above-mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create a class Solution with the main method.
Implement two static methods – countGrainByGivenName and getMinGrainFromMaharashtra in the Solution class.

countGrainByGivenName
Create a static method countGrainByGivenName in the Solution class.
This method will take an array of Grain objects and a String as input, and return the count of Grain objects whose grainName matches the input (case insensitive).
If no such object exists, return 0.

getMinGrainFromMaharashtra
Create a static method getMinGrainFromMaharashtra in the Solution class.
This method will take an array of Grain objects and return the Grain object that belongs to state "Maharashtra" (case insensitive) and has the minimum qtyinQuintal among them.
If no such Grain is found, return null.

These methods should be called from the main method.
Write code to perform the following tasks:
Take necessary input and call countGrainByGivenName.

The main method should print the count returned.

If the returned value is 0, print:
"No Grains with matching names are found"

Take necessary input and call getMinGrainFromMaharashtra.

The main method should print the full Grain object (each attribute in a new line) if the returned value is not null.

Else, it should print:
"No Grains with matching names are found"

Note:

All String comparisons should be case-insensitive.

The above-mentioned static methods should be called from the main method only.

Don’t use any static test or formatting for printing the result. Just invoke the methods and print the results directly.

Use Scanner for input.

Instructions to write the main method:
The 1st input is the number of Grain objects (an integer).

For each Grain, input is:

grainid (int)

grainName (String)

state (String)

qtyinQuintal (int)

After all object inputs,

Take a String input for grainName to search

Call countGrainByGivenName.

Then, call getMinGrainFromMaharashtra.
