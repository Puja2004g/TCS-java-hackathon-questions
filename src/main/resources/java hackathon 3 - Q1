Create a class Journalist with the below attributes:

id – int

name – String

experience – int

region – String

The above attributes should be private. Write appropriate getters, setters, and a parameterized constructor.

Create a class Solution with the main method.

Implement the following two static methods in the Solution class:

🔹 findAverageExperienceByRegion method:
Takes two input parameters – an array of Journalist objects
and a String region.

Returns the average experience of all journalists from the
given region.

If no journalist is found from the given region, return 0.

🔹 searchJournalistById method:
Takes two input parameters – an array of Journalist objects and
an int id.

Returns the Journalist object whose id matches the given id.

If no such Journalist exists, return null.

📌 Additional Instructions:
The id of the journalist is unique.

You must call these static methods from the main method.

Before calling the static methods, use Scanner to read data for n Journalist objects in the given order of attributes:

id (int)

name (String)

experience (int)

region (String)

Then read:

A String value for region to be passed to findAverageExperienceByRegion

An int value for id to be passed to searchJournalistById
