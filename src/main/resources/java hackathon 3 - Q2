Create a class Photographer with the below attributes:

id ‚Äì int

name ‚Äì String

specialization ‚Äì String

rating ‚Äì double

All the above attributes should be private. Write appropriate getters, setters, and a parameterized constructor.

Create a class Solution with the main method.

Implement the following two static methods in the Solution class:

üîπ countPhotographersBySpecialization method:
Takes two input parameters ‚Äì an array of Photographer objects
and a String specialization.

Returns the count of photographers who match the given specialization (case-insensitive).

If no photographers match the specialization, return 0.

üîπ getSecondHighestRatedPhotographer method:
Takes an array of Photographer objects.

Returns the Photographer object with the second highest rating.

If no such Photographer exists (i.e., fewer than 2 unique
ratings), return null.

üìå Additional Instructions:
id is unique for each photographer.

No two Photographer objects will have the same name and id.

The rating can be duplicated among multiple photographers.

These static methods must be called from the main method.

Use Scanner in the main method to:

Read values for n Photographer objects in the order:
id, name, specialization, rating

Then read a string for specialization to be used in countPhotographersBySpecialization.
